# miniProject

Friday I wrestled with the API and I was trying to pull data into the front-end, but the API was only set up for server side. This took up most of the day and I looked in every nook and cranny before emailing support.

I was pulling in data fine with Postman, but I was having CORS issues when trying to pull the data into my browser. With the help of a few exchanged emails with David Noble, I was able to learn some PHP to pull data into a backend then pull it to front-end.


"GET" was working fine, but I could not get "POST" working, even in Postman, because there were some errors referencing payment methods, payment types among others.

Since I could not get "POST" to work, I hard coded in an order number that appears after the order is submitted.

DESIGN: I used Bootstrap for design to keep content organized, but I mostly concentrated on logic and making things work.

METHODS: Angular, Angular Routes, PHP, Git, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS


Cheers,
